							<p><b>What I Did:</b> I created and implemented scripts that were key components for our game. 
								The components include: The main menu, pause menu, end game menus, item pick up, speed boost, and speedometer.  </p>
								<p><b>Challenges Overcame: </b> The biggest challenge was being a programmer. I had no programming experience prior to this project, so I had to learn on the fly. 
								I had to think on the fly about what was needed and how to do it. If I couldn’t figure out how to create a script for something,
								then I needed to find a way to reapproach the problem. The biggest problem for me at the time was getting the speed boost to work properly.
								After not being able to create a script to make it work, I created an invisible game object that would accelerate the car when the car collided with it. </p>

							<p><b>What I Did:</b> I was the team's lead designer. I lead the team by making sure communication was kept and keeping 
								track of what needed to be added to the build. When the scope of the game became too big for us to tackle, 
								I shorten it to make sure we met the deadline while adapting to the sudden change. </p>
								<p><b>Challenges Overcame:</b> The biggest challenge was adapting to the new COVID environment. 
									The sudden change to online classes wasn’t easy but I helped get us through it. I created a 
									communication follow that kept the team up to date with each other every day or every other day via Discord.

						<p><b>What I Did:</b> I was the mechanics designer. I designed and balanced all the mechanics for this project. 
							And when needed, I created new units and gave them designs and mechanics as well. 
							My job ranged from designing and balancing weapon costs to balancing and playtesting stratagems. </p>
							<p><b>Challenges Overcame:</b> The most difficult challenge for me was making sure I kept up with the lore team.
								 I didn’t want to design or balance something that didn’t stick with lore. 
								 Since all teams were developing on different parts of the project, 
								 communication would at times fall through the cracks. To prevent that, 
								 I would directly speak and engage with the lore team and at times, 
								 be a part of their meetings to make sure I understood the direction I needed to take the designs. </p>

						<p>Storm the Castle was my first VR (Virtual Reality) project and my first time in the level design role. 
							Storm the Castle is a medieval theme VR game where the player is going storming a castle and defeating enemies outside and inside the castle.
							While a part of the level design team, I had to do level concepts on paper 
							first then take what was drawn and greybox the level in Unity to playtest. 
							Once our levels were implemented, I began to prop placing and quality assurance testing.
							After doing quality assurance testing, I came across frame rate issues. Because of these issues,
							 we used our limited resources to give that dungeon feel

						<p><b>What I Did:</b> I was a designer that focused on creating puzzles for kids to solve. 
							The puzzles would have pipes that would allow the kids to place them down before time runs out. 
							With each level completed, the puzzles would become more difficult little by little. </p>
							<p><b>Challenges Overcame:</b> The biggest challenge for me 
								was making sure these puzzles were easy enough for children to solve. It couldn’t be too easy and it 
								couldn’t be too difficult. I had to make it difficult enough to be challenging, engaging, and fun.</p>
