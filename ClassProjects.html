							<p>Imaginary shift was my first team project. This team had 8 designers and 1 artist. Since there were no programmers, 
								I was assigned with being the programmer for this project.  
								With the programmer role, I had to overcome the obstacle that is programming. 
								I learned how to create and implement scripts into Unity while building a racing game. 
								<p>I created scripts for the main menu, pause menu, and the end screen menu. 
								These menus had 3 different jobs. The main menu gets the player into the game,
								the pause menu stops the game and shows a menu that the player can choose from, 
								and the end screen menu allows the player to play again or leave game.
								Although these menus were one of the first to be implemented, 
								I later added the speedometer display and implemented pickups that the player could use during the race. </p>

							<p>Abiogenesis was a very difficult project. We had a team that consisted of 4 people. 1 programmer, 1 artist, and 2 designers. 
								The idea behind this game was the player being a space explorer that crash landed on a planet where they must figure out a way to escape. 
								while finding out that there were other people that crashed there years before. 
								Over time, the player would begin finding out that there were other people that crashed landed before them. 
								The idea was to make it a short puzzle game but due to COVID, 
								I had led the team to pivoting and finding ways to adapt to the new COVID environment.

							The X’Tal was a Warhammer 40,000 army. The focus of this project was creating a new army and codex that could be used for the tabletop game. 
							 I spent time creating units and playtesting them against other armies. 
							 I went on to not only create and balance these units but to create units and their abilities from scratch.
							 While a part of the mechanics' team, I had a very important part in the team that didn’t just include playtesting and balancing.
							While on this team I created abilities and a few units for the Gems, Glass, and Ore. I’ve also designed and balanced the weapons 
							that each unit would use during their time of play. </p>

						<p>Storm the Castle was my first VR (Virtual Reality) project and my first time in the level design role. 
							Storm the Castle is a medieval theme VR game where the player is going storming a castle and defeating enemies outside and inside the castle.
							While a part of the level design team, I had to do level concepts on paper 
							first then take what was drawn and greybox the level in Unity to playtest. 
							Once our levels were implemented, I began to prop placing and quality assurance testing.
							After doing quality assurance testing, I came across frame rate issues. Because of these issues,
							 we used our limited resources to give that dungeon feel

						<p>Follow that Pipe is a Discovery World project that my class was assigned with creating. Follow that Pipe is an
							educational game created for the purpose of teaching the player about energy and where it comes from. 
							As a designer, I had to create puzzles that would be simple enough for children to solve since this 
							project would be on display at the Discovery World “Power On” energy exhibit.  </p>
							<p>Unfortunately, we never got the chance to see the project fully come together but there’s an article that gives a brief description 
							of the game and the video here gives an idea of how simple I wanted to keep the puzzles designs and the educational facts being showen.
