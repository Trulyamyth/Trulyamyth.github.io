							<p><b>Responsibilities:</b> During this project, my responsibilities were to ensure that different teams were informed of any issues that I encountered. 
								I collaborated with the design team to address gameplay problems and worked with the art team to ensure all art elements were implemented seamlessly. 
								Additionally, my role involved certification testing for both PlayStation and Xbox platforms, validating that the project met and surpassed the qualifications for both consoles.</p>
								<p><b>Challenges:</b> The main challenge I encountered during this project was understanding Mortal Kombat’s gameplay mechanics. 
									While I had some understanding of the fighting game genre, I had to broaden my understanding of both the fighting game genre and the specific details of Mortal Kombat. 
									This included learning and understanding fighting game terminology like “plus-on-block” and “special cancel”, along with learning Mortal Kombat-specific terms like “up block”.  </p>

							<p><b>Responsibilities:</b> I designed puzzles for kids, featuring pipes they could place before time ran out. 
								My role also involved playtesting these puzzles to ensure they were solvable and suitable for kids aged 4-12.</p>
								<p><b>Challenges:</b> The challenge I faced during this project was ensuring the puzzles were just right for kids—neither too easy nor too hard. 
									They needed to be challenging, engaging, and fun. Since we lacked playtesters from our target audience, the design team, including myself, playtested the puzzles. 
									We frequently encountered the problem of having overly complex puzzles. 
									To address this, I suggested gradually increasing the puzzle difficulty as the game progressed. 
									Completing each level would make the puzzles a bit more challenging, striking the right balance between simplicity and difficulty.</p>

							<p><b>Responsibilities:</b> I served as the team's level designer, responsible for crafting initial greybox levels and enriching the environment through color schemes and prop placement. </p>
								<p><b>Challenges:</b> The main challenge was crafting an alien world from scratch, especially with no prior level design experience. 
									I needed to make something unique while still telling a story through the level. In our game concept, players would experience the planet in different time settings. 
									The present portrayed a barren landscape, while another time setting was vibrant with life. 
									I created contrasting levels to represent these settings. To overcome this challenge, I extensively researched reference art and conducted numerous prototypes, testing various environmental colors.

						<p><b>Responsibilities:</b> As the systems designer, I managed the design and balance of project mechanics.
							 I created new units with their designs and mechanics, and my tasks involved balancing weapon costs and playtesting stratagems. </p>
							<p><b>Challenges:</b> My main challenge was staying aligned with the lore team. I aimed to ensure that my designs and balances stayed true to the established lore. 
								Early on, there was a conflict between our unit designs and how the lore team was describing them. 
								To prevent future issues, I suggested having a systems team member, often myself or the team lead, attend lore team meetings. This significantly improved communication between the teams.

						<p><b>Responsibilities:</b> Designed how our game would fit the “Joined Together” theme. Then greyboxed levels and obstacles for players to complete. 
							This led to me implementing level designs, obstacles, and the main menu.  </p> 
							<p><b>Challenges: </b> We had to create a game that aligned with the “Joined Together” them in 72 hours. 
								We had multiple ideas of what to do but scraped them quite often. I gave the idea of there being 2 controls, 1 for each player. 
								A platform game that requires 1 player to use the keyboard to maneuver throughout the course with the help of the other player to place platforms 
								for both players to succeed. </p>

						<p><b>Responsibilities:</b> Implemented UI/UX, in-game features related to item pick up, speed boost, and speedometer.  </p>
							<p><b>Challenges: </b> The biggest challenge was being a programmer. I had no programming experience before this project, 
								so I had to learn on the fly. I had to think and figure out what was needed and how to do it. 
								If I couldn’t figure out how to create a script for something, then I needed to find a way to reapproach the problem. 
								To solve these problems I had to do things 1 step at a time. Figure out what I want to do and how am I going to do it.
								 I would break the problem down into a simple form. Then I would figure out the best way to solve this problem. 
								 For example, the speed boost. I didn’t know how to make the speed boost work or even where to start. 
								 I did a lot of research into creating scripts that would cause an object to change speed. 
								 This gave me the idea of creating an invisible cube that gives the player a speed boost for a certain about of time when the player 
								 collides with it. Just have to take it one step at a time. </p>

						<p>Storm the Castle was my first VR (Virtual Reality) project and my first time in the level design role. 
							Storm the Castle is a medieval theme VR game where the player is going storming a castle and defeating enemies outside and inside the castle.
							While a part of the level design team, I had to do level concepts on paper 
							first then take what was drawn and greybox the level in Unity to playtest. 
							Once our levels were implemented, I began to prop placing and quality assurance testing.
							After doing quality assurance testing, I came across frame rate issues. Because of these issues,
							 we used our limited resources to give that dungeon feel
