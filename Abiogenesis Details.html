										</header>	
										<a href="images/whitebox.png"  target = "_blank" class="image fit"><img src="images/whitebox.png"></a>
										<p>Greyboxing started with simple shapes and test assets to display the cave structure we wanted to add to our game. 
											The idea was to make something obvious enough for the player to want to explore and use that curiosity as a way to point them in the 
											right direction.

										<p>Using the asset store for a better representation of my vision. 
											I used free assets from the Unity Asset Store to place props and add color to the level to 
											experiment with how I could create a desert. I didn’t want to jump straight to making 
											an alien planet because I needed to see what a desert would look like before altering it.

										<p>The game of reference for color was Astroneer. 
											Using a mixture of vibrant colors but muting them to create that desert feel was the plan. 
											I wanted to create the feeling that the environment use to be and feel alive but then died off over time, 
											creating a dry and barren environment.

										<p>I added the colors for testing purposes and added the particle effects to see if they would fit with the game. 
											I had the idea of the player being in a desert storm at the start of the game. 
											But, it was later taken out due to performance issues during playtesting. </p>

										<p>The final product of the level became exactly what I envisioned it to be. 
											Dull in the beginning, a dark cave that uses crystals and mushrooms to illuminate the environment, 
											and a very vibrant and alive environment that the player would travel through.

										<p>This was my take on the Street Fighter V main menu. I did this redesign as a personal project for learning Adobe XD. 
											UI/UX design is something I have a lot of interest in, so redesigning a main menu was all just for fun.

										<p>This was my idea of a main menu and HUD. I wanted to create something without any reference. 
											The goal was to be creative and do things without looking at other games. I wanted to keep this as a  learning experience. I wanted to 
											figure out what I wanted to do, how I was going to do it, then create it.

									<p>
										This Talon redesign was something I wanted to try. I have friends that play a lot of League of Legends and when I watch them play, 
										they talk about this displeasure with his passive ability. I started playing him and he quickly became my favorite champion. 
										 I found that I enjoyed the way he played but I felt that there were tools that could be added to his kit. 
										 I read into Talon’s lore and researched his mechanics. That’s when I decided to try my hand at doing a redesign. There are more reasons for this redesign, give it a read</a>.

									<a href="https://remedial4life.itch.io/friendly-geometry"  target = "_blank" class="image fit"><img src="images/Friend.jpg" alt="" /></a>
									<p>Our July 2021 Game Jam project. I did this project with a group of friends over the span of 72 hours. 
										During those 72 hours, I designed how our game would play in order to fit the “Joined Together” theme. 
										Then I greyboxed levels and obstacles for players to complete. This led to me designing the levels and implementing them into the final build. 
										After designing the levels, I began programming the moving obstacles then implementing the main menu.</p>
